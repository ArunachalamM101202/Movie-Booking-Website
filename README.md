# Movie-Booking-Website
This is a fully functional movie booking website which helps the user to book a movie ticket at his/her preferred time and day.The website also allows the user to select which individual seat he/she prefers and does not allow the user to select a seat if it has been already booked by another user. The user can also become a Gold or a Silver member. There is also an option to purchase snacks at the end. Once a ticket has been booked, the user will recieve a mail of the ticket details to the email id he/she had used to create an account at the start.There is also a method called Forgot Password which sends a new password to the user through email. The user can later change the password in the profile section.
