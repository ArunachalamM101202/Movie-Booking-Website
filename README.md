# Movie-Booking-Website
This fully functional movie booking website helps the user book a movie ticket at his/her preferred time and day. The website also allows the user to select which individual seat he/she prefers and does not allow the user to select a seat if it has already been booked by another user. The user can also become a Gold or Silver member. There is also an option to purchase snacks at the end. Once a ticket has been booked, the user will receive a mail of the ticket details to the email id he/she used to create an account at the start. There is also a method called Forgot Password which sends a new password to the user through email. The user can later change the password in the profile section.

This website was created on 10th July 2021 by [Arunachalam M](https://github.com/ArunachalamM101202 "Profile link").
